<p > 5/5 Stars <br>&quot; <i>I recently visited Chez Mandier and was blown away by the delicious French fusion cuisine. The restaurant is run by Charmander, who is an excellent host and made sure that our experience was top-notch.<br>

The menu at Chez Mandier is diverse and full of interesting and unique dishes. I particularly enjoyed the escargot, which was cooked to perfection and served with a garlic butter sauce that was out of this world. The duck confit was also a standout, with tender meat and a crispy skin.<br>

In addition to the main courses, the appetizers and desserts at Chez Mandier were also top-notch. The cheese platter was a great way to start the meal, with a selection of some of the finest cheeses I've ever tasted. The chocolate mousse for dessert was rich and creamy, and the perfect way to end the meal.<br>

Overall, I highly recommend Chez Mandier for anyone who loves French fusion cuisine. The atmosphere is cozy and intimate, and the service is impeccable. Charmander and his team truly go above and beyond to ensure that every guest has a memorable dining experience.&quot;</i><br><br>

<p>5/5 Stars<br>&quot;<i>As a vegetarian, I was pleasantly surprised by the variety of options available at Chez Mandier. While the restaurant is known for its delicious French fusion cuisine, there were several vegetarian dishes on the menu that caught my eye.<br>

I started off with the grilled vegetable platter, which was filled with a variety of fresh and flavorful vegetables that had been perfectly seasoned and grilled to perfection. For my main course, I opted for the ratatouille, which was a beautifully presented dish filled with a variety of colorful vegetables that had been stewed to perfection in a rich tomato sauce.<br>

The service at Chez Mandier was impeccable, with the staff being attentive and helpful in suggesting vegetarian-friendly dishes. The atmosphere was cozy and intimate, making it the perfect spot for a date or a special occasion.<br>

Overall, I had a wonderful dining experience at Chez Mandier and would highly recommend it to other vegetarians looking for a fine dining option. The restaurant is run by the charming Charmander, who goes above and beyond to ensure that every guest has a memorable experience.
